This is a non-programming post in the series I call "re-stating the obvious". This series talks about topics that already boast extensive literature, I'm merely adding my own annotations. You can find all posts in this series [here](/blog/tags/obvious).

## An anectode

I start this post with an anecdote. The era was 1990s and the scene was a bus stand. While my father and I were waiting for a bus, a hawker approached us with a bunch of imitation Casio watches. Here's the conversation that ensued:
>**Father:** How much for that watch?
><br>
>**Hawker:** 100 rupees
><br>
>**F:** That is a lot for a watch. Why is it so expensive?
><br>
>**H:** It has a lot of amazing features ...
><br>
>**F:** Like what?
><br>
>**H:** See this button here? It activates the stop watch ... and look, it glows in the dark ... and also, it is water resistant ... and oh, do you see the strap? It is reversible .. and ...
><br>
>**F:** I see the watch is running behind by 5 minutes. Why is that?
><br>
>**H:** Oh that is probably because the light and stopwatch consume a lot of battery
><br>
>**F:** So you are trying to sell me a watch that does not even tell the time correctly but has lot of other useless fancy features?

## Feature creep

Wikipedia has a great definition of [featue creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). To paraphrase it, and add my own flavor to the definition:
> Feature creep is the tendency to add advanced features to a system even before the main purpose of the existence of the system is fulfilled.

I say "system" but feature creep could also occur in a narrower scope, i.e., a subsystem of a system (more on this in a bit). Let's take a look at some examples.

### Smartphones

A smartphone is perhaps the obvious example that comes to mind. Smartphones function as calculators, cameras, navigation devices, alarms, calendars, books, entertainment devices and a whole bunch more. With so much functionality crammed in, the fundamental purpose of making and receiving phone calls has taken a back seat. All the other features use up resources like battery, leaving very little for actual phone calls.
