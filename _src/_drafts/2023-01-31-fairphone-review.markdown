This post is the second in a series of businesses that are positive and sustainable. With this series, I want to show that it is possible for for-profit businesses to be ethical and sustainable. You can read all posts in this series [here](/blog/tags/positive-bytes).

## About Fairphone

[Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/about/about-us/) is a smartphone manufacturer based in The Netherlands, but it is unlike any other smartphone manufacturer. Their [entire mission](https://www.fairphone.com/en/story/) is to make the electronics industry more fair. As you will see in this post, this involves so much more than just the product itself.

Their first product launched in 2013 and at the time of writing this they're selling their 4th generation smartphone ([FP4](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/buy-fairphone-4)). I've been using a [Fairphone 3+](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/fairphone-3-plus) (now discontinued) as my only phone since July 2021 and have been happy with it.

But what's [so different](https://youtu.be/gkmzDwgvqQM) about Fairphone? Let's dive in.

## The products

Fairphone products are what would be considered mid-range Android phones. That's not their most appealing feature though. At a time when "market leaders" had policies that would result in your warranty being void for the most ridiculous reasons, Fairphone phones were designed to be repairable. For example, the FP3 received a perfect [iFixit score of 10](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fairphone+3+Teardown/125573).

My FP3+ came with a screwdriver in the box. The side has "Designed to open" etched on it. Making repairs and replacing parts is easy even for users who are not tech-savvy (I would liken it to repairing Ikea furniture).

And remember, all of this was long before right-to-repair was a thing.

## Hardware to last

The philosophy of Fairphone is to use a phone for as long as it lasts. In other words, they have steered clear of the "release a new product every year and entice you to upgrade every year" poisonous cycle that is now pretty standard in the electronics industry. There are 2 steps to achieve this:

1. Making it easy to repair and replace parts, as I already mentioned above
2. Offering spare parts for as long as one can expect a phone to be reasonably used.

I'm writing this in January 2023. Today, spare parts like camera module, display module and battery are [still available](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/spare-parts) for the FP2 which was launched in 2015. You read that right. 

> Official, original spare parts are still available in 2023 for a phone that was launched in 2015!!.

## Model lineup to last

This is kind of a corollary to the previous point. In 10 years, Fairphone has only released 4 models (5, if you consider the 3 and 3+ as different models). Just doubling the time between consecutive releases results in an exponential increase in sustainability. FP has proved that there is simply no need to keep churning out model after model endlessly.

## Software to last

I get a feeling that Fairphone's philosophy of longevity also extends to their software. The phone comes with Android that is very close to stock. But there's more than that.

FP3+ was released in 2020 with Android 10. Since then it has been updated to Android 11. While it has not received major OS updates since, I still receive regular security updates. For example, my phone has the "5 December 2022" security update installed.

My initial impression of this was negative - I was of the opinion that for a phone to last long, it must offer major OS updates for 4 years. However, the more I read up about this, the more I realized that the continuous OS updates could be detrimental to sustainability.

The big Smartphone OS vendors seem to be locked in a vanity war - of releasing "major" OS updates every year. How major these updates really are is debatable. However, for smartphone OEMs, the race to provide updates is not really sustainable. An annual cycle is hugely disruptive and the effort spent in there could be well utilized elsewhere - for example to provide security updates for older models.

My conclusion is that by staying away from the rat race and instead opting to priotitize security updates for even older models, Fairphone has managed to settle on a software model that is more sustainable for themselves and for their customers.
