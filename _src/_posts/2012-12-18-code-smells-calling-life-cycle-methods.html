<p>Here is some code I see that sets off alarm bells clanging in my head: </p><blockquote><p>Explicitly calling life-cycle methods of components <strong>that are outside your control</strong>. </p></blockquote><p>Since that sounds oh-so-generic, let me illustrate by way of example.</p><p>Assume you are writing a <code>Servlet</code> and your implementation doesn't care whether the request was a POST or a GET (in the current RESTful world, this should never be the case, but let's keep that aside for the purposes of this post). So, the following would appear to be a reasonable implementation:</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {<br />    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {<br />        //Handle the request <br />    }<br /><br />    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {<br />        doGet(req, resp); //Just call doGet<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>I would never do this though. This is because <code>doGet</code>, <code>doPost</code> and the other <code>doXXX</code> methods are life-cycle methods of the <code>Servlet</code>. I have no control over when and how the servlet engine calls them. I also have no control over what the engine does once these methods return. It is possible that the engine performs some house-keeping tasks once a <code>doGet</code> returns, and that action could be different from what is done once a <code>doPost</code> returns.</p><p>It is really a simple matter of extracting the "common functionality" between such life cycle methods into a method and calling that method.</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {<br />    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {<br />        handleRequest(req, resp);<br />    }<br /><br />    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {<br />        handleRequest(req, resp);<br />    }<br /><br />    /**<br />     * Method that extracts out the common functionality between GET and POST requests<br />     */<br />    private void handleRequest(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp){<br />        //Handle the request<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><h4>What if the life cycle methods are in an Interface?</h4><p>One opinion that came up in a discussion was that it is safe to call other life-cycle methods if they are in an <code>interface</code> as opposed to a <code>class</code>. Note that the above code sample extends <code>javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet</code> which is an <code>abstract class</code> as opposed to the base <code>javax.servlet.Servlet</code> which is an <code>interface</code>. This has come up specially while discussing callbacks. </p><p>I disagree with this opinion since it assumes that any book-keeping has to be performed by the same  (possibly <code>abstract</code>) class that denotes the life-cycle component. This is not true. Take an imaginary UI toolkit for example, which has a <code>Pane</code> as a UI element. Now, assume an interface for handling interaction callbacks:</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>interface InteractionListener{<br />    public void onClick();<br />    public void onRightClick();<br />    public void onLongClick();<br />    public void onDoubleClick();<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>In this case again, assume that you want the same action to be performed on long-click and right-click. So, you might be tempted to do this:</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>Pane pane = // ...<br /><br />pane.setInteractionListener(new InteractionListener(){<br />        public void onClick(){<br />            //Handle single-click<br />        }<br /><br />        public void onRightClick(){<br />            //Handle right-click<br />        }<br /><br />        public void onLongClick(){<br />            onRightClick();<br />        }<br /><br />        public void onDoubleClick(){<br />            //Handle double-click<br />        }<br />});<br /></code></pre><p>This is <em>still</em> wrong. Yes- <code>InteractionListener</code> is an interface and there is no way it can have a concrete method that might perform house-keeping tasks. However, you have no control over how the UI toolkit engine invokes the call-backs. You also have no control over what action the engine takes <em>after</em> your <code>onXXXClick()</code> methods return. The solution, again is exactly the same as before: extract the common code into a method which you then invoke from both <code>onLongClick()</code> and <code>onRightClick()</code>.<br /></p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Avoid calling one component life-cycle method from another, when the component in question is outside your control. This could lead to unpredictable behavior. Simply refactor the common behavior into a method and call that method from both life-cycle call-backs.</p><p>A few other instances where I have seen this sort of code:</p><ul><li><p>Android's <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html"><code>SqliteOpenHelper</code></a>. In the <code>onUpgrade()</code> method, you probably want to take a backup of data, drop the tables, add new columns, and then re-create the tables. The implementation often looks like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>public class MySqliteOpenHelper extends SqliteOpenHelper{<br />    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db){<br />        //Use SQL CREATE TABLE statements to create the tables.<br />    }<br /><br />    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion){<br />        /*<br />         * 1. Take backup of data<br />         * 2. Drop tables<br />         * 3. Add columns<br />         *<br />         * And finally:<br />         */<br />        onCreate(db); //This is not right.<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>The right way to do this would be:</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted" style=""><code>public class CorrectSqliteOpenHelper extends SqliteOpenHelper{<br />    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db){<br />        createDatabase(db);<br />    }<br /><br />    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion){<br />        /*<br />         * 1. Take backup of data<br />         * 2. Drop tables<br />         * 3. Add columns<br />         *<br />         * And finally:<br />         */<br />        createDatabase(db);<br />    }<br /><br />    private void createDatabase(SQLiteDatabase db){<br />         //Use SQL CREATE TABLE statements to create the tables.<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre></li></ul><p>I will re-visit this post and add more instances as and when I come across them.</p><script>prettyPrint()</script>
