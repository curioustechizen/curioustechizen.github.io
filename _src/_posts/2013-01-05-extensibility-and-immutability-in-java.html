<h3>Objective:</h3><blockquote><p><strong>To devise a way to make thread-safe, a Java class designed to be extensible.</strong></p></blockquote><h3>Introduction:</h3><p><em>Effective Java, Second Edition: Item 15</em> says <strong>"Minimize Mutability"</strong>. One should always try to make a class immutable. This has several advantages that I will not go over here (Since <em>Effective Java</em> explains it all). I will however point out one of those advantages since it is central to this discussion: </p><blockquote><p><strong>Making a class immutable is the easiest way to ensure that the class is thread-safe.</strong></p></blockquote><p>There is however a problem: to make a class <em>truly immutable</em>, you must prevent it from being sub-classed. Either the class must be declared <code>final</code>, or it should have a <code>private</code> constructor and provide <code>static</code> factory methods instead of constructors. The reasons for this are outlined in <em>Effective Java</em>. The basic premise is that a sub-class can violate the immutability guarantees. </p><p>This must-not-be-subclassed restriction may be fine if you are applying immutability to some <em>value object</em> like <code>User</code>, <code>Point</code>, <code>Account</code> etc. However, the same requirement turns out to be overly restrictive if you are applying the concept to <em>logic classes</em>. This is because logic classes are often meant to be customized by extension. </p><h3>A strongly-immutable logic class:</h3><p>As an example of a logic class, consider the following ReportGenerator:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>public final class ReportGenerator{<br />    private final DatabaseLayer mDatabaseLayer;<br />    private final PresentationLayer mPresentationLayer;<br /><br />    public ReportGenerator(DatabaseLayer db, PresentationLayer pres){<br />        this.mDatabaseLayer = db;<br />        this.mPresentationLayer = pres;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void generateMonthlyReport(User user){<br />        Report report = mDatabaseLayer.getReport(user);<br />        mPresentationLayer.present(report);<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>The other classes have been ommitted for brevity. Assume that <code>DatabaseLayer</code> and <code>PresentationLayer</code> classes are themselves immutable. This makes <code>ReportGenerator</code> <strong>strongly immutable</strong> and hence, thread-safe.</p><p>Now, suppose in the next phase of the project, you need to add a way to generate a historical report.  The easiest way that comes to mind is to inherit from <code>ReportGenerator</code>. Unfortunately, we cannot do this since in order to make <code>ReportGenerator</code> immutable, we have declared it <code>final</code>. One possible approach to solving this issue is making <code>ReportGenerator</code> <strong>weakly immutable</strong>. This is discussed in the next section.</p><h3>A weakly-immutable logic class:</h3><p>One can relax the restriction that an immutable class must not be extensible, while still maintaining the guarantees, <strong>provided the sub-class adheres to the established contract</strong>. This is done by removing the <code>final</code> modifier from the class declaration, and making all fields <code>protected final</code>, or keep them <code>private final</code> and provide getters which we then use in the sub-classes. Both these approaches are shown in the code below.</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>public class ReportGenerator{<br />    protected final DatabaseLayer mDatabaseLayer; //protected field approach<br />    private final PresentationLayer mPresentationLayer; //private field with accessor approach<br /><br />    public ReportGenerator(DatabaseLayer db, PresentationLayer pres){<br />        this.mDatabaseLayer = db;<br />        this.mPresentationLayer = pres;<br />    }<br /><br />    public PresentationLayer getPresentationLayer(){<br />        return this.mPresentationLayer;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void generateMonthlyReport(User user){<br />        Report report = mDatabaseLayer.getReport(user);<br />        mPresentationLayer.present(report);<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>We can now sub-class this as follows:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>public class HistoricalReportGenerator extends ReportGenerator{<br /><br />    public HistoricalReportGenerator(DatabaseLayer db, PresentationLayer pres){<br />        super(db, pres);<br />    }<br /><br />    public void generateHistoricalReport(User user, Duration duration){<br />        Report historicalReport = mDatabaseLayer.getReport(user, duration);<br />        getPresentationLayer().present(historicalReport);<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>We could also have added more <code>protected final</code> fields to the sub-class if needed. </p><p>What we now have is a weakly immutable class. <strong>This class is immutable as long as sub-classes adhere to the contract</strong>. It is a good idea to establish in the class javadoc, the expectation that sub-classes <strong>MUST</strong> preserve the same weak immutability restrictions that this class adheres to. If a sub-class willfully violates the contract, then the logic class cannot be depended upon to work correctly.</p><p>Here's an example to how to establish this contract:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>/**<br /> * The logic class that generates the report.<br /> * ... ...<br /> * &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br /> * This class is &lt;em&gt;weakly immutable&lt;/em&gt;. It has been kept open for <br /> * extensibility. Sub-classes &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; preserve the immutability <br /> * guarantees of this class. In particular, they must have only immutable <br /> * fields; and must not override any of the methods defined in this class to<br /> * return a mutable reference.<br /> *<br /> */<br /><br />public class ReportGenerator{<br />    //Class body omitted.<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>Since immutability is enforced by documentation rather than by the compiler, this is an acceptable compromise. It allows us to easily create thread-safe classes that are also extensible. This makes writing API's and frameworks that much easier.</p><h3>Thread-safety is more than Immutability:</h3><p>Of course, making a class immutable is not the only way to make a class thread-safe. A mutable class can be written such that it is thread-safe too. It is often desirable for an object to change its state during the execution of a program. How that is done is beyond the scope of this article. I suggest looking at <em>Java Concurrency In Practice</em> for details on this topic.</p><h3>Extending the logic class by Composition:</h3><p>There exists an alternative way to extend the functionality of <code>ReportGenerator</code> that does not involve inheriting from it: <strong>"Favor Composition over Inheritance"</strong> (<em>Effective Java, Second Edition, Item 16</em>). For completeness, I present the code for this approach here. Do note that this example uses the strongly immutable form of <code>ReportGenerator</code>.</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>public final class ReportGenerator{<br />    private final DatabaseLayer mDatabaseLayer;<br />    private final PresentationLayer mPresentationLayer;<br /><br />    public ReportGenerator(DatabaseLayer db, PresentationLayer pres){<br />        this.mDatabaseLayer = db;<br />        this.mPresentationLayer = pres;<br />    }<br /><br />    public PresentationLayer getPresentationLayer(){<br />        return this.mPresentationLayer;<br />    }<br /><br />    public DatabaseLayer getDatabaseLayer(){<br />        return this.mDatabaseLayer;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void generateMonthlyReport(User user){<br />        Report report = mDatabaseLayer.getReport(user);<br />        mPresentationLayer.present(report);<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />public final class HistoricalReportGenerator{<br />    private final ReportGenerator mReportGenerator;<br /><br />    public HistoricalReportGenerator(ReportGenerator reportgen){<br />        this.mReportGenerator = reportgen;<br />    }<br /><br />    public ReportGenerator getReportGenerator(){<br />        return this.mReportGenerator;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void generateHistoricalReport(User user, Duration duration){<br />        Report historicalReport = mReportGenerator.getDatabaseLayer().getReport(user, duration);<br />        mReportGenerator.getPresentationLayer().present(report);<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>This approach works fine when the class hierarchy is only a couple of levels deep. If it gets deeper than that, then getting a handle to the members of the base class becomes unwieldy. For example, suppose we have the following:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>public class AnnualReportGenerator extends HistoricalReportGenerator<br />public class LeapYearReportGenerator extends AnnualReportGenerator<br /></code></pre><p>Now imagine a method in <code>LeapYearReportGenerator</code> needs access to the <code>DatabaseLayer</code> object. The code for this would look lik:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>mAnnualReportGenerator().getHistoricalReportGenerator().getReportGenerator().getDatabaseLayer();<br /></code></pre><p>This is clearly something you want to avoid. With the composition approach, you also lose the runtime polymorphism advantage.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>To summarize what this article discussed:</p><blockquote><ul><li>The easiest way to make a class thread-safe is to make it immutable.</li><li>Strong immutability closes the door on extensibility.</li><li>It is often convenient to make a class weakly immutable. This allows it to be sub-classed.</li><li>If you make an immutable class extensible, clearly establish in the javadoc, the contract that sub-classes must preserve the immutability guarantees.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Other than these observations, we also saw that:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Immutability is not the only way to achieve thread-safety, and in fact immutability is not always desirable.</li><li>Instead of inheriting from a weakly immutable class, one can also extend the functionality by composing a class with a strongly immutable object as its member. This has its own pros and cons - and both approaches must be evaluated before deciding on one.</li></ul></blockquote><script>prettyPrint()</script>
