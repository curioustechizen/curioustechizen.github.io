# What's this?

Source for my personal blog.
- Implemented as an [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) SSG
- Content is written using Markdown, all the HTML is generated at build time
- Based on [Dante Astro theme](https://github.com/JustGoodUI/dante-astro-theme)
- In December 2024, this site was migrated from Jekyll (where it was using the [materi-for-jekyll](https://github.com/ogaclejapan/materi-for-jekyll)) theme

# TODO

- [x] Create a custom 404 page ([docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#custom-404-error-page))
- [x] Sitemap and robots.txt files
- [ ] Migrate the non-blog landing pages from my previous implementation (like the [Covid19 India flutter app landing page](https://github.com/curioustechizen/curioustechizen.github.io/tree/9b3e09bc6c7b2009867295c9534818c61268214a/covid19india))
