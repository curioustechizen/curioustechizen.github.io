In [Part 1](http://curioustechizen.blogspot.in/2012/03/internationalization-in-spirit.html)
of this series, I touched upon how software should target a wider
audience by being easy to consume by people around the planet. I used
the term "internationalization" in that post, but I really meant a
combination of internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n). In
this post, and the rest of this series, I use these terms
interchangeably. I realize technically speaking they are different but I
really think both these terms should for the most part, be mentioned in
the same breath.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, the biggest missing piece in the whole global software
story is cultural sensitivity. When designing, developing and
distributing software, we often overlook the fact that the user of this
software could be from a culture that is diametrically opposite to our
own. Let me refrain from taking names; but for a moment take a look at
the list of software installed on your computer or phone and you will
know what I mean. ***How many of the concepts presented in these
software are you really familiar with?***

I will draw up a list of hypothetical examples here to drive home my
point:

-   Imagine a software tool that has one particular “fun” feature and
    names it Aloha. Now an American might immediately associate Aloha
    with Hawaii and therefore with fun, but what difference does it make
    to a person on the other side of the globe?
-   Imagine a role playing game in which one particular level involves
    the player attending high school prom. If your game targets a global
    audience, chances are most of your users have never been to prom;
    and those who do not have Hollywood influence don’t even know what a
    prom is.
-   Suppose you have a game where you grade your players according to
    high scores. What do you think would be the consequence of grading
    them as “Sachin”, “Viru”, and “Dhoni”? I’m sure people from
    non-cricketing nations reading this post won’t even get the
    reference.

One can go on and on pulling out examples, but you see where this is
heading, don’t you? The underline here is this: ***In an attempt to make
a product more user-friendly, we tend to link it to things that we see
and use every day. Unfortunately, we fail to realize that those very
“things” might be totally unheard of*** in markets where our products
are targeted.

I don’t believe there is an easy solution though. None of the options
seem to be good in their own right.

-   It is highly improbable that one will find one concept that fits all
    cultures.
-   The costs associated with adapting the very concepts the product is
    based on, to various cultures, is sure be prohibitive.
-   Keeping things culture-neutral is likely to make the product dry and
    boring - a kill-joy for sure.

In the end it is a matter of finding the balance that works for you. But
before arriving at that formula, it is worth considering the cultural
aspect in some detail so as to be in the good books of all end-users!

In the next installment of this series, we will look at how the software
development community could be more inclusive of developers around the
world.
